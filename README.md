## A trivia repository with interactive gameplay, built with BackEnd and FrontEnd technologies: Flask, UnitTest, PostgreSQL, React.

This project is a trivia web app that practices fundamentals in CRUD, as part of Udacity's Fullstack Developer Nanodegree Program. Users are able to review a list of trivia facts, categorized by topics: Science, Geography, Art, History, Movies, and Sports. Users are also able to add new trivia as well as delete trivia facts. They can search by queries and by categories and receive filtered results through those actions. Finally, users can test their trivia knowledge and play a game with randomly assorted questions, from one category or all. 

By completing this project, I was able to apply my skill in structuring and implementing well formatted API endpoints that leverage knowledge of HTTP and API development best practices. Also utilized TDD on the Backend while building out the route handlers for the various endpoints and adding proper error handling.

All backend code follows PEP8 style guidelines. 

All frontend code is rebuilt using React Hooks.
